My program takes in input from the text file "sequence1" as shown on the left

Running it will prompt the user for whether the sequence is DNA or mRNA

The polypeptide/amino acid sequence corresponding to the mRNA/DNA sequence is printed in the terminal

Additionally, a plot of the amount of each amino acid is displayed
Here you can see that the mRNA sequence results in a lot of the Arg amino acid



Now I will run the same program, except this time with the DNA sequence instead of the mRNA sequence

This resulting polypeptide has a lot of Ser and Thr
